## 2025-05-15 - Improving Window Control Accessibility
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons in a desktop-like UI (like red/yellow/green dots) are highly inaccessible if they lack ARIA labels. Users relying on screen readers need dynamic labels that reflect the state (e.g., "Restore window" vs "Maximize window").
**Action:** Always ensure icon-only buttons have descriptive `aria-label` attributes and update them dynamically when they represent togglable states.
