# muenstererOS

> A personal website for Dennis Muensterer (@dnnsmnstrr)

The muenstererOS application is built with SvelteKit and hosted on Vercel.
Its design is inspired by operating systems like macOS, using shadcn-svelte components
to recreate elements like the menu bar, dock, draggable windows and a command bar / launcher.
