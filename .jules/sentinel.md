## 2025-05-22 - Open Redirect via Redirect Utility

**Vulnerability:** Open Redirect and Path Traversal via the `restPath` parameter in the `getRedirectURL` utility.
**Learning:** The application allowed arbitrary strings to be appended to a redirect URL via the `restPath` parameter. Attackers could use `../` to traverse out of the intended path or `//` to create a protocol-relative link to an external domain.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize parameters that are used to build URLs for redirection. Use robust regex to remove traversal sequences and leading slashes that could be interpreted as protocol-relative.
